About Me

Hello, I'm Shubharthak Sangharasha, a software engineering student deeply passionate about Machine Learning and Computer Vision. My work ranges from crafting intelligent voice assistants like Apsara AI to real-time gesture-based volume controllers.

I'm driven by a commitment to continuous learning and the belief that technology can make a positive impact. Explore my projects to see how creativity and innovation come together in my work.

Apsara AI - Voice Assistant

Designed and developed using Python with integrations such as gTTS, Spotify, smptlib, speech recognition, etc.

Capabilities include playing songs on Spotify, reading news, scheduling calendar meetings, connecting Bluetooth, searching Wikipedia, setting alarms, and more.

Dynamic Volume Controller

Built using Google's open-framework Mediapipe for real-time 3D face and hand landmarks estimation.

Allows adjusting the computer volume using hand gestures, dynamically adjusting based on the person's distance from the laptop.

Face Mask Detection

Detects whether a person is wearing a mask using Tensorflow and MobileNetv2 architecture.

Notifies the admin through email if mask enforcement is not followed and the mask is not worn for 30 seconds.

NodeMCU Smart Car

Engineered a Smart Car using NodeMCU ESP8266 for wireless control and monitoring.

Integrated Blynk IoT for a user-friendly Android and web interface, providing remote accessibility.

Work Experience

Backend Web Development Intern
Curve Tomorrow, Melbourne, Australia
June 2022 - August 2022

Implemented a User Log System for auditing purposes. Added a CMS (Content Management System) to enable admins to add/edit pages without developer's involvement, thereby reducing turn-around time from days to minutes. Collaborated with team members globally.

You leapt from crumbling bridges
Watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing
In the ocean from way above
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers
Wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos
Left in the dark
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers
Flood is rising up on your knees
Oh, please
Come out and haunt me
I know you want me
Come out and haunt me
Sharing all your secrets with each other
Since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you
Clutched in your fist
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
Ooh, oh
When you're all alone
I'll reach for you
When you're feelin' low
I'll be there too
